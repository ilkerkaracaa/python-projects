# There are 3 python projects in this repo.

## The 1st one is a simple 2D game.

In the Alien Invasion project,I use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game.

## 2nd one is a Data Visualization application.

The Data Visualization projects, generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly.

## 3rd one is a Web Application.

In the Web Application project, I use the Django package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep a journal about different topics theyâ€™ve been learning about.
